# TypeScript Error Fix Summary

## Issue

TypeScript was complaining about type incompatibility for the `verificationType` field:

- Expected type: `"pending" | "verified" | "rejected"`
- Actual type: `string`

## Solution

Added a type assertion to explicitly tell TypeScript that the string literal `'pending'` is of the correct union type:

```typescript
verificationType: 'pending' as 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected',
```

## Why This Happened

TypeScript's type inference treats string literals as type `string` by default, not as the specific literal type. When assigning to a property that expects a union of specific string literals, we need to explicitly assert the type.

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Use a constant**:

   ```typescript
   const VERIFICATION_PENDING = 'pending' as const;
   verificationType: VERIFICATION_PENDING,
   ```

2. **Use an enum**:

   ```typescript
   enum VerificationType {
     PENDING = 'pending',
     VERIFIED = 'verified',
     REJECTED = 'rejected'
   }
   verificationType: VerificationType.PENDING,
   ```

3. **Type the entire object**:
   ```typescript
   return agreements.map(
     (agreement): AgreementListData => ({
       // ... other properties
       verificationType: 'pending',
     })
   );
   ```

## Result

- The TypeScript errors are resolved
- The application builds successfully
- No runtime behavior changes
