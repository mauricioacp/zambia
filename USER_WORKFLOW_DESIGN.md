const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'executive',
    loadChildren: () => import('./executive/executive.module').then((m) => m.ExecutiveModule),
    canActivate: [roleGuard],
    data: { groups: ['ADMINISTRATION', 'TOP_MANAGEMENT', 'LEADERSHIP_TEAM'] },
  },
  {
    path: 'management',
    loadChildren: () => import('./management/management.module').then((m) => m.ManagementModule),
    canActivate: [roleGuard],

  },
];
```
