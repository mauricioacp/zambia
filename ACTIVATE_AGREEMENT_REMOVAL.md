# Activate Agreement Action Removal

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed "Activate Agreement" Action**

- Removed the action button from the table actions array
- Removed the `onActivateAgreement` method from the component
- The facade service method `activateAgreement` remains available for potential future use

### 2. **Rationale**

- Agreement activation is now handled automatically when creating a user
- The "Create User" action for pending/inactive agreements will:
  1. Create the user account
  2. Automatically activate the agreement
  3. Update the agreement status to 'active'
- This simplifies the workflow and prevents confusion

### 3. **Updated Workflow**

For agreements with different statuses:

- **Pending/Inactive agreements (no user)**: Show "Create User" action
- **Active agreements (with user)**: Show "Deactivate User" and "Reset Password" actions
- **All agreements**: Show "View" and "Deactivate Agreement" actions

### 4. **User Experience Improvement**

- Fewer clicks required - one action creates user AND activates agreement
- Clearer workflow - no need to activate agreement separately
- Prevents accidental activation without user creation

## Verification

- The component builds and lints successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- The table now shows appropriate actions based on agreement and user status
