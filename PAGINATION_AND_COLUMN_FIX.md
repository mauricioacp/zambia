# Pagination and Column Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Agreement Type Column**

- Removed the `agreementType` column from the table columns array
- Removed the `agreementType` field from the `AgreementListData` interface
- Removed the `agreementType` field from the data transformation function

### 2. **Fixed Pagination**

- Changed the facade service to fetch 1000 records from the database
- This allows the enhanced table component to handle pagination on the client side
- The table will now properly paginate through all available records

## How It Works

The enhanced table component uses client-side pagination, which means:

1. The facade fetches a large batch of records (1000) from the database
2. The table component handles filtering and pagination on the client side
3. Users can navigate through pages using the table's built-in pagination controls

## User Experience

- Users can now see all agreements with proper pagination
- The table shows 25 records by default (configurable to 10, 25, 50, or 100)
- The agreement type column has been removed as requested
- Pagination controls show the current page and total number of records

## Performance Considerations

Fetching 1000 records at once is acceptable for most use cases. If you have more than 1000 agreements, consider:

1. Implementing server-side pagination in the enhanced table component
2. Or increasing the fetch limit in the facade service
3. Or implementing a custom pagination solution

## Verification

To verify the fixes:

1. Check that the agreement type column is no longer visible
2. Check that pagination controls work properly
3. Check that you can navigate through all pages of agreements
4. Check that the page size selector works (10, 25, 50, 100 records per page)
